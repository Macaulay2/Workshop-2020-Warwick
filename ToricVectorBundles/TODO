1) Compute cohomology of a toric vector bundle or toric reflexive sheaf
For toric vector bundles, this is already implemented in the package ToricVectorBundles.
Idea is by Klyachko that gives a specific resolution to compute the cohomology in a given degree. 
Problem: the estimate for the locus with non-zero cohomology is a bit too big in ToricVectorBundles

2) Computation of Chern data, equivariant and usual one, using Klyachko's description

3) Pass between toric reflexive sheaves (in Klyachko's description) and graded modules over the Cox ring
The direction from sheaves to modules should not be too hard.
For the converse direction, there are two caveats:
* note that a graded module encodes an arbitrary sheaf over the toric variety.
* two graded modules can encode the same sheaf (if they differ by something from the irrelevant ideal)
So for the converse direction, we might want to
* find a canonical ("saturated") representation of a module
* take its double dual to get its reflexive hull
* implement a check whether it is equivariant 
* implement a way to deform the module to an equivariant one 
  (in analogy to deform an ideal to a monomial ideal, there are finitely many possibilities)
Note that with such a way to pass between sheaves and modules, we can compare computations (cohomology and Chern are already available on the side of modules).

4) computation of pullback (this should be fairly easy)

-------------
The following ones are quite open, and need also much theoretical thought

5) computation of pushforward

6) Boij-Soederberg theory for toric varieties

7) Derived categories of toric varieties

8) Minimal model program for toric varieties
