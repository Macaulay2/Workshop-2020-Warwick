-- INSTRUCTIONS -------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Installing this package produces errors; debug it.
-- 2. Eliminate the warning messages
-- 3. Add a new test.
-- 4. Create a second copy of this package in a different directory 
--    and load each copy.  How do you do know which copy you have
--    installed?
-- 5. Bundle some existing Macaulay2 into your own package.

    toStack
  Headline
    creates a stack
  Usage
    toStack L
  Inputs
    L : BasicList 
  Outputs
    : Stack
      a stack containing element in the given order    
  Description
    Text
      A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements,
      with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the
      collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element.
    Example
      S1 = toStack {1,2,3,4,5}
      S2 = pop S1
      S3 = push(1,S2)
      S1 === S3
    Text
      Here is a random example.
    Example
      S4 = toStack for i to 5 list random(5)
      S5 = pop S4
      S6 = pop S5
