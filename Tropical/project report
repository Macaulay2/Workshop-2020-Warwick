I. Bergman Fan
  DONE
    - Bergman fan now works for a loopless matriod with ground set [0,...,n]
  TODO:
    - tests and documentation
    - should work for arbitrary ground set 
    - should return tropicalCycle and not just the Fan
    - figure out the mysterious "star" problem 
II. Puiseux
   DONE:
    - new object created - tropicalCycle1: tropical polyhedral complex with multiplicities
    - function tropicalVarietyWithPuiseuxVal (Ideal) works, outputs tropicalCycle1: tropical polyhedral complex with multiplicities
    - two methods to retrieve the polyhedral complex and multiplicities of T= tropicalCycle1: multiplicities(T) and fan(T);
    - documentation - exists for the new functions
    - 1-2 tests
  TODO:
    - more tests
    - currently to get the polyhedral complex from a T = tropicalCycle1 you call fan(T), we need a new method with the correct name.
    - to work out the projection of the complex so it doesn't live in the plane t = 1.
    - big project - make everything work for TropicalCycle1.
III. p-adic
  TODO:
    - write a wrap function for gfan_padic in gfanInterface.m2 
    - use that to compute tropicalization wrt p-adic valuation - output should be of type tropicalCycle1.
IV. isBalanced
  DONE:
    - wrote and tested IsBalanaced for curves
  TODO:
    - to test star command
    - test and document for higher dimensions
    - more examples towards testing star
