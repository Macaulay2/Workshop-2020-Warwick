     SubalgebraBases
   Headline
     a package for finding canonical subalgebra bases (aka SAGBI bases)
   Description
    Text
      Let $R=k[f_1,\ldots,f_k]$ denote the subalgebra of the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ generated by $f_1,\ldots ,f_k.$ We say 
      $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ form a {\it subalgebra basis} with respect to a monomial order $<$ if the {\it initial algebra}
      associated to $<$, defined as $in(R) := k[in(f) \mid f \in R],$ is generated by the elements
      $in(f_1), \ldots , in(f_k).$

     subduction
     (subduction, ZZ, Matrix, RingMap, GroebnerBasis)
   Headline
     Perform a subalgebra reduction of the entries of the one row matrix M.
   Usage
     result = subduction(numparts, M, F, C)
   Inputs
     numparts:ZZ
       The number of parts in the monomial order of the original ring.
     M:Matrix
       A one row matrix with entries in the ambient ring of a subalgebra R. Usually only involves the variables in the f_i.
     F:
       A ring map R -> R sending x_i to f_i.
     C:
       A GB of an ideal of the form x_i - m_i where m_i is the lead monomial of f_i. Must be computed in high enough degree to handle the elements of M.
   Outputs
     result:Matrix
       A matrix with no monomials contained in the subalgebra generated by the monomials m_i.
   Description
    Text
       The resulting matrix will have no monomials which are in the subalgebra generated by the 
       monomials m_i. Each entry of M and the corresponding entry of the result differ by an element of the subalgebra generated by the f_i.
